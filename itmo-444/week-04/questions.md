## Chapter 03 - Selecting a Service Platform

1. Compare IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS on the basis of cost, configurability, and control.
IaaS: Cost: Varying based on your needs
      Configurability: High configurability, can install own OS and Software
      Control: High, as all you are doing is basically renting a machine + bandwidth
PaaS: Cost: Varying, but usually higher than IaaS due to the provided framework
      Configurability: Low, restricted to what the service platform provides.
      Control: Not much control do to being limited to the provided frameworks
SaaS: Cost: Low cost
      Configurability: Some configurability offered through the provider based on your needs
      Control: No control over the software, systems, etc, all is handled by the provider

2. What are the caveats to consider in adopting Software as a Service?
You need to consider making the client's data easy to migrate and to
close their accounts, even if it means giving them an easy way to move
to a competing provider.

3. List the key advantages of virtual machines.
* They don't need the standard resources of a normal machine, allowing
one big machine to run many smaller virtual machines
* They're easy to create and destroy
* Controllable through software and can be programmed

4. Why might you choose physical over virtual machines?
Virtual machines share resources if run on the same machine, and can "steal" CPU resources

5. Which factors might make you choose private over public cloud services?
A private cloud would offer superior privacy and control over your stored data and the systems that store and host that data and applications. It also will make sure that you comply with certain standards.

6. Which selection strategy does your current organization use? What are the benefits and caveats of using this strategy?
My current organization uses a SaaS (G Apps) for email and Drive storage, while SAT uses their own servers to host their own services that they use to maintain the labs.
